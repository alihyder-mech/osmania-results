# Osmania fake result generator
This is a simple fake result generator which scrapes data from actual OU's website and generates a completely random result

To run this on a linux machine, just clone it and navigate into the virtual env with
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now if you happen to be on windows, then delete ```venv``` folder and create a new virtual env, idk why but do it,

install all dependencies from ```requirements.txt``` and run ```app.py```
